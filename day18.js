// --- Day 18: Course Schedule II ---

// There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

// Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

// Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, return the ordering of courses you should take to finish all courses.

// There may be multiple correct orders, you just need to return one of them. If it is impossible to finish all courses, return an empty array.

// Example 1:

// Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
// Output: [0,1]
// Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. To take course 1 you should have finished   
//              course 0. So the correct course order is [0,1] .

// Example 2:

// Input: 4, [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]
// Output: [0,1,2,3] or [0,2,1,3]
// Explanation: There are a total of 4 courses to take. To take course 3 you should have finished both     
//              courses 1 and 2. Both courses 1 and 2 should be taken after you finished course 0. 
//              So one correct course order is [0,1,2,3]. Another correct ordering is [0,2,1,3] .
// Note:

// The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
// You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

// ----------

// first, create a reverse adjacency list based on the dependencies. this way, we can look in O(1) time to see which prerequisites a course will have. then do a DFS topological sort on the graph
// represented by the adjacency list - for any node we visit, first we will recurse on its prerequisites. every time we visit a node, we first mark it "gray" in a `seen` object. while recursing up
// a chain of prerequisites, we should not encounter a gray node - if we do, then we have found a cycle. once we find a node that has no prerequisites, we can mark it "black" in the `seen` object.
// in order to do this DFS, we use a helper function whose purpose it is to visit a given node. this function also returns a boolean for whether there is an absence of a cycle (`false` means there is
// a cycle, while `true` means there is not). first the helper checks if we have already seen this node - if so, and it's gray, then we return `false` (cycle detected), or else it's black and we 
// return `true`. if it's not in the `seen` object, we mark it as gray, and then recurse through all of its prerequisites first. (if any of those come back `false`, we also return `false`.) once we
// finish that process we are ready to mark this node as black and return `true` (along with pushing it into the `output`). in the main function, then, we simply iterate through all our courses and
// call `helper` on them. if at any point we get a `false` result then a cycle was detected, so we ultimately return an empty array. else, we ultimately return `output`.
